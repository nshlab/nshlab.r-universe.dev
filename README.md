# An (R) universe of our own

This repo configures how some of our group's R packages, available on GitHub,
are distributed via the R universe package repo at
<https://nshlab.r-universe.dev/>. See also the R universe GitHub repo at
<https://github.com/r-universe/nshlab/>, which includes automated builds of R
packages via GitHub Actions.
