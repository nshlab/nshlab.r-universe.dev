# An (R) universe of our own

This repository provides a configuration for how some of our group's R packages,
available on GitHub, are distributed via the R universe package repository at
<https://nshlab.r-universe.dev/>. See also the R universe GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/r-universe/nshlab/>, which includes automated builds of R
packages via GitHub Actions.
